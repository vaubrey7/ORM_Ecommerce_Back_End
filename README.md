## Description 

        Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019.
        
        E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.
        
        Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a full-stack web developer.
        
        Your task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

        Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, youâ€™ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. 
        
        Youâ€™ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.


## Installation 

Be sure to initialize! Start the prompts by running 'node server.js' from the terminal.

[Sequelize Info + Resources](https://gist.github.com/zcaceres/742744b708393c022703b615d1bffbb1)
Sequelize: "Sequelize is a powerful library in Javascript that makes it easy to manage a SQL database. ... At its core, Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapper â€“ meaning that it maps an object syntax onto our database schemas. Sequelize uses Node. JS and Javascript's object syntax to accomplish its mapping."


## Contribution 

Feedback is greatly appreciated Especially since I had this working and now it's not. I know its probably something small. But right now I just can;t see it.
